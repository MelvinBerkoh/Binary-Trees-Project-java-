# Binary-Trees-Project-java-

Write a program to represent the Morse code as a binary tree. The dot symbol (.) should cause a
branch to the left and the dash symbol (-) a branch to the right. The data field of each node
should be the letter represented by the corresponding code. The top part of the tree will look
like this with the root represented by a ‘*’. 
The input of the program should consist of a letter, and the code string. After the complete tree
has been built, from a file allow a message in Morse code to be entered. Then print the message
in English.
